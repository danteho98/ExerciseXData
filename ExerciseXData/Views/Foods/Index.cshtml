<p>
    The Food Pyramid is a visual guide to help individuals understand the recommended proportions of different food groups in their diet. While the exact calorie intake can vary based on factors like age, sex, activity level, and dietary needs, here’s a general breakdown of average calorie contributions from each food group based on a daily intake of around 2,000 calories:
    
    <br /><br />
    Grains (6-8 servings): 900-1,200 calories

    Focus on whole grains, such as brown rice, whole wheat bread, and oats.
    Vegetables (3-5 servings): 200-400 calories
    <br />
    <br />
    Aim for a variety of colors and types, including leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, and root vegetables.
    Fruits (2-4 servings): 150-300 calories
    <br />
    <br />
    Include fresh, frozen, or dried fruits like apples, berries, bananas, and oranges.
    Dairy (2-3 servings): 300-600 calories
    <br />
    <br />
    Choose low-fat or fat-free options like milk, yogurt, and cheese.
    Protein (2-3 servings): 200-400 calories
    <br />
    <br />
    Incorporate lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, nuts, and seeds.
    Fats and Oils (sparingly): 100-200 calories
    <br />
    <br />
    Focus on healthy fats from sources like olive oil, avocados, and nuts.
    Example Daily Breakdown (2,000 calories):
    Grains: 1,000 calories (7 servings)
    <br />
    Vegetables: 300 calories (4 servings)
    <br />
    Fruits: 200 calories (2 servings)
    <br />
    Dairy: 400 calories (3 servings)
    <br />
    Protein: 300 calories (2 servings)
    <br />
    Fats: 100 calories (1 serving)
    
    
    Summary:
    Based on a balanced diet from the Food Pyramid, a daily intake of about 2,000 calories might break down as follows:

    Grains: ~50%
    Vegetables: ~15%
    Fruits: ~10%
    Dairy: ~20%
    Protein: ~15%
    Fats: ~5%
    <br />
    <br />
    Summary of Average Daily Caloric Intake by Gender and Age:
    <br />
    Males:
    Young Adults (18-25): 2,800-3,000 calories<br />
    Adults (26-45): 2,600-2,800 calories<br />
    Middle-aged (46-65): 2,400-2,600 calories<br />
    Older Adults (66+): 2,000-2,400 calories
    <br />
    <br />
    Females:
    Young Adults (18-25): 2,200-2,400 calories 
    <br />
    Adults (26-45): 2,000-2,200 calories
    <br />
    Middle-aged (46-65): 1,800-2,000 calories
    <br />
    Older Adults (66+): 1,600-1,800 calories
    <br />
    <br />
    Notes:
    These values can vary based on factors such as activity level, metabolism, and individual health goals.
    Generally, more active individuals may require more calories, while those with sedentary lifestyles may require fewer.
